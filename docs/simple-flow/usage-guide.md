# Simple Flow Usage Guide

Use the five skills as human-invoked stage boundaries.

## Normal FEATURE

1. Use Discussion to explore the request. It stops after summarizing consensus.
2. Use Issue-Draft to create a Canonical Draft. It stops after reporting the Draft ID.
3. Review the draft as a human.
4. Use Start-Implement with the approved Draft ID. It stops at Human PR Review.
5. Review the pull request as a human.
6. Use PR-Finalize with the accepted PR. It merges only after objective checks pass.

## Review-Triage Flow

When PR Review finds a problem, use Review-Triage. It classifies the finding and
stops. Then use Issue-Draft for the next approved change and Start-Implement for
the specified Draft ID.

## PROJECT_CHANGE

Use Issue-Draft to create a PROJECT_CHANGE draft. Start-Implement updates only
approved project documents and does not require TDD. PR-Finalize is still the
only merge entry point after human review.
