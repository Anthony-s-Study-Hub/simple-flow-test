# Simple Flow Review-Triage

Owned Stage: Review-Triage

Use this skill only after a human PR review identifies a finding.

## Responsibilities

Classify exactly two dimensions:

- Relationship: CURRENT, SUBISSUE, or NEW ISSUE.
- Merge Impact: BLOCKING or FOLLOW-UP.

The output must also include:

- Source Issue
- Source PR
- Reason

The result remains conversation context. It is not written to a state file.

## Boundaries

- Do not edit Issues.
- Do not modify code.
- Do not create branches or pull requests.
- Do not fix the finding directly.
- Do not invoke or simulate Issue-Draft.

After outputting the classification, STOP.
